# Raspberry PI OS

## What is this?

This is an operating system for the Raspberry Pi 3B written completely from scratch by yours truly :)

It is not intended to be useful.
Nor is it intended to provide a great example for OS development.
It's just my little programming playground.

_Hello recruiters ^^_

## What's in the package?

- A monolithic terminal integrated into the kernel
- SD card driver
- Slab allocator
- Buddy block allocator
- Virtual file system (WIP)
- Interrupt handling (WIP)
- Platform timer (WIP)
- Virtual memory (WIP)
- `printf`
- Lots, and lots, and lots of bugs

## Todo
