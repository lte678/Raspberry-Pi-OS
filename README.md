# Raspberry PI OS

## What is this?

This is an operating system for the Raspberry Pi 3B written completely from scratch by yours truly :)

It is not intended to be useful.
Nor is it intended to provide a great example for OS development.
It's just my little programming playground.

_Hello recruiters ^^_
